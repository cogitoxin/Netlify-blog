Lucia is a slow learner, a born skeptic, and an not-so-planner planner.
She was born in China and lives in New York. She speaks Chinese, English, Japanese and is currently leaning German. 
She is obsessed with language philosophy and all forms of literature, as well as cuddle toys. 
She is striving to learn more about how planners can do better in their work, presumably for a lifetime. For practical reasons, she is also interested in graphic design, web typography as well as data visualization.
